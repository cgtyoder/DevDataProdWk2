## Open Data 500 Companies and Locations

Assignment:  Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

First, load in data:
```{r}
# This file was obtained from https://gist.github.com/erichurst/7882666
zips <- read.csv("USZip.csv")

# This file was obtained from http://www.opendata500.com/us/list/
open500 <- read.csv("us_companies.csv")

# Remove companies with no ZIP Code data
open500 <- open500[!is.na(open500$zip_code), ]

joined <- merge(open500, zips, by.x = "zip_code", by.y = "ZIP")
latsLongs <- data.frame(lat = joined$LAT, lng = joined$LNG)
popups <- paste0("<a href='", joined$url, "'>", joined$company_name, "</a>")
```

```{r}
library(leaflet)

myMap <- latsLongs %>% 
    leaflet() %>% 
    addProviderTiles(providers$OpenStreetMap) %>%
    addTiles() %>%
    addMarkers(popup = popups, clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
myMap
```
